About this source tarball
=========================

This source tarball containing some tools for Catalan spell-checking
has been bundled together by Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org> and
Agustin Martin Domingo <agmartin@debian.org> after selected files from 
upstream SVN repo (svn://softcatala.org/corrector, stuff under
trunk/resultats).

ispell (catalan-i.aff, catalan-i.dic):
--------------------------------------
This contains ancient 20061016 version because of some problems with
last version.

myspell/hunspell (catalan-m.aff, catalan-m.dic,
catalan-valencian-m.aff, catalan-valencian-m.dic):
--------------------------------------------------
This contains 20111230 version with some minor changes,
 - Explicit "WORDCHARS .-'" line added to affix files.
 - Fixed buggy ^(rigués|somrigués) lines in catalan-m.dic. Old
   20061016 as been restored (Q flag has not been changed across both
   releases). 

aspell:
-------
Added 20111230 catalan-valencian-extra-a.dic with extra Catalan
Valencian words. Mostly for use with aspell together with a common
Catalan wordlist extracted from catalan-m.dic.

Changelog, Copyright:
---------------------
While found under aspell dir seems to apply to all other stuff.
